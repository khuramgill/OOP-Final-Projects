# Windows Forms Projects Repository

Welcome to the Windows Forms Projects Repository! This repository contains three different projects, all developed using the Pure Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#. 

## Projects

### 1. Cars Management System

The Cars Management System is a project that demonstrates effective utilization of Object-Oriented Programming principles. It allows you to manage a collection of cars, enabling operations like adding new cars, updating existing ones, and removing cars from the system. The project showcases concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

#### Features

- Add new cars to the system with details like make, model, year, and price.
- Update information for existing cars.
- Remove cars from the system.
- Display a list of all cars with their details.

### 2. Front Line Game

Front Line Game is an engaging Windows Forms game project developed using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. This game provides an interactive gaming experience where the player takes on the role of a soldier on the front line, engaging in intense battles against enemies. The project demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, and interfaces to create a modular and extensible game structure.

#### Features

- Player-controlled character with movement and shooting capabilities.
- Various types of enemies with distinct behaviors and abilities.
- Health and ammunition management for the player.
- Dynamic game environment with obstacles and power-ups.
- Game scoring and level progression.

### 3. Fast Food Point - Point of Sale System

The Fast Food Point project is a Point of Sale (POS) system that efficiently manages customer orders in a fast-food setting. Built with the principles of OOP in mind, this project showcases the use of classes, interfaces, and inheritance to create a robust and user-friendly POS application. It enables the creation and processing of orders, along with tracking sales and inventory.

#### Features

- Create new orders by selecting items from the menu.
- Calculate the total cost of the order.
- Process payments through various payment methods.
- Manage inventory of available food items.
- Generate sales reports and summaries.
